# Fibonacci sequence using recursion functions
This program operates on the Fibonacci sequence using the recursive algorithm. Itâ€™s a classic example of how recursion can be used to solve mathematical problems.

How It Works
Base Cases:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1.
For these base cases, we return the corresponding values directly.
General Rule:
For all other values, we use the rule:
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
This means the Fibonacci of a given value is equal to the sum of the Fibonacci values of the two preceding values.
